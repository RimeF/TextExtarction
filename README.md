# TextExtarction
In this rep, I will extract text from two different images.

First, a satellite image. I ran my image through 3 different parsers: EasyOCR, Tesseract and Keras OCR.
The later provet to be more efficient. 

As for extracting text from a table, I used an existing library; img2table. It allowed me to have an xlsx file containing the extracted table.
